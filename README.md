These are the visuals for repo DashBoard, if you would like to have a look at the code, please get intouch!

# Dashboard

This project is made with Svelte, TypeScript, and CSS. It is hosted on Vercel. The dashboard is displayed at my home, in the hallway, to make life a little bit easier. With this dashboard that displays both the timetable from the stop and the platform of your choice, you are less likely to waste time waiting for the next departure outside and can instead plan your travels with a bit more ease.

It supports translations for English, French, and Swedish due to a multilingual household. To enhance the dashboard further, weather data for both Gothenburg and Rennes has been added. Additionally, to help you dress appropriately for the day, the current weather conditions are also displayed.
